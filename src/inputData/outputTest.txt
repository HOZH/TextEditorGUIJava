The menu bar must have at least a File menu, View menu and Edit menu. The File menu should have menu items such as New, Open, Close, Save, and Exit. The Save and Open menu items should be supported by a file chooser to allow the user to choose files in folders. You also need to implement a text file filter (.txt) for the file chooser so it will only display folders and text files with the extension of .txt. The View menu should have menu items such as Word Count, Sentence Count, and Flesch Score. When such a menu item is selected, the corresponding value should be displayed on the status bar. A text file (WarAndPeace.txt) is provided here to test your implementation. The file needs to be loaded and saved as one single string rather than multiple individual strings. The Edit menu should have copy, cut, delete, and paste menu items, each working correctly. Although not required, it would be even better if you could implement a context menu so the user may invoke each by right-clicking the mouse. In addition, the Edit menu should also contain a menu item called Markov. This menu item will implement an automatic text generator. The text generator would be trained with WarAndPeace.txt using linked lists as we did before. It is able to generate a new text based on an initial word and a number specifying the length of the auto-generated text. The auto-generated text should be displayed in the main text area, and the initial word and the length should be provided by the user on a pop-up input dialog when the Markov menu item is clicked.
