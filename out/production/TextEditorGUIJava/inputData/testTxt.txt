History is mysterious, especially in a diversified place like American, but it is also the reason that why it's fascinating. When I was reading the second chapter, I started thinking about why couldn’t colonists and native Americans just live in peace with each other. After I studied the letters in the document project and do the research, my opinion is that in the early age of colonization in American, the dispute between colonist and native American was the mean cause that led to King Philip’s War. 
Because of the mistreatment, the relation between English colonist and native Indian became tense. King Philip and the attorney general John Easton had a meeting before King Philip’s War about their conflict. Philip related the Indians’ many complaints, which included the sale of liquor to Indians, the destruction of their crops, and their mistreatment under the colonial justice system.”1 The British limited their sales of wine and destroyed the Indian crops to provoke them. For more excessive circumstance, they treated Indian differently under their justice system. “The Massachusetts government having made a law that every Indian being drunk should pay ten shillings or be whipped.”2 It had a positive impact on the government's finances at first place. But farther many poor Indian were more willing to take the lash because it could save their money. As more Indian were willing to be lashed rather than paying the fine, Massachusetts government enforced ten days working policy to take place of lash. Another example of mistreatment is about King Philips’ land. He had a great land named Mount Hop, some people wanted to dispossess it, they play tricks on the court. “ Whereupon the Sachem [King] Philip was often summoned to appear before the magistrates, sometimes imprisoned, and never released but uponparting with a considerable part of his lands.”3 In my opinion, arrest without official reason was the discrimination. It could be fine in the beginning, but as the mistreatment was being felt by more and more Indian, it led to the extreme discontent of Indian. They didn’t treat Indians fairly and set many restrict in Indian people’s basic needs and wants. It increased the tension between colonist and Indian.
